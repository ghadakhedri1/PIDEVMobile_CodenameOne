        <p>Background fetch is a mechanism whereby an application is granted permission by the operating system to update its data periodically.  At times of the native platform's choosing, an app that supports background fetch will be started up (in the background), and its {@link com.codename1.background.BackgroundFetch#performBackgroundFetch(long, com.codename1.util.Callback) } method will be called.</p>
