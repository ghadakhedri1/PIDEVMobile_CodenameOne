        All components are animatable by potential and additional animations (unrelated
        to a specific component) can be installed on the fly, transitions between
        forms are also handled as part of this package. Animation thread handling
        and painting is handled uniformly to avoid the complexity of threading and 
        its potential performance penalty on small devices.
