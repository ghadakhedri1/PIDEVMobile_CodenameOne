        <h1>Networking, Storage, Filesystem &amp; related API's</h1>
        <p>
            The IO package includes all of the main features related to storage and networking with the exception
            of {@link com.codename1.db SQL} &amp; XML parsing.
        </p>

        <h3>Storage</h3>
        <p>
            {@link com.codename1.io.Storage} is accessed via the <code>Storage</code>
            class. It is a flat filesystem like interface and contains the ability to list/delete and 
            write to named storage entries.
        </p>

        <p>
            The {@link com.codename1.io.Storage} API also provides convenient methods to write objects to 
            {@link com.codename1.io.Storage} and read them from {@link com.codename1.io.Storage} specifically 
            <code>readObject</code> &amp; <code>writeObject</code>.<br>
            Notice that objects in {@link com.codename1.io.Storage} are deleted when an app is uninstalled but are 
            retained between application updates.
        </p>

        <p>
            The sample code below demonstrates listing the content of the storage, adding/viewing and 
            deleting entries within the storage:
        </p>

        <img src="https://www.codenameone.com/img/developer-guide/storage-content.png" alt="Content of a file added to the storage" />

        <h4>The Preferences API</h4>

        <p>
            {@link com.codename1.io.Storage} also offers a very simple API in the form of the 
            {@link com.codename1.io.Preferences} 
            class. The {@link com.codename1.io.Preferences} class allows developers to store simple variables, strings, 
            numbers, booleans etc. in storage without writing any storage code. This is a common use case 
            within applications e.g. you have a server token that you need to store you can store &amp; read it like this:
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/codenameone/fc7693ef69108e90057c.js"></script>

        <p>
            This gets somewhat confusing with primitive numbers e.g. if you use 
            <code>Preferences.set("primitiveLongValue", myLongNumber)</code> then invoke 
            <code>Preferences.get("primitiveLongValue", 0)</code> you might get an exception!<br>
            This would happen because the value is physically a <code>Long</code> object but you are 
            trying to get an <code>Integer</code>. The workaround is to remain consistent and use code 
            like this <code>Preferences.get("primitiveLongValue", (long)0)</code>.
        </p>

        <h3>File System</h3>
        <p>
            {@link com.codename1.io.FileSystemStorage} provides file system access. It maps to the underlying 
            OS's file system API providing most of the common operations expected from a file API somewhat in 
            the vain of <code>java.io.File</code> &amp; <code>java.io.FileInputStream</code> e.g. opening, 
            renaming, deleting etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            Notice that the file system API is somewhat platform specific in its behavior. All paths used the API 
            should be absolute otherwise they are not guaranteed to work.
        </p>

        <p>
            The main reason <code>java.io.File</code> &amp; <code>java.io.FileInputStream</code> 
            weren't supported directly has a lot to do with the richness of those two API's. They effectively 
            allow saving a file anywhere, however mobile devices are far more restrictive and don't allow 
            apps to see/modify files that are owned by other apps.
        </p>

        <h4>File Paths &amp; App Home</h4>
        <p>
            All paths in {@link com.codename1.io.FileSystemStorage} are absolute, this simplifies the issue of portability 
            significantly since the concept of relativity and current working directory aren't very portable.
        </p>

        <p>
            All URL's use the <code>/</code> as their path separator we try to enforce this behavior even in 
            Windows.
        </p>

        <p>
            Directories end with the <code>/</code> character and thus can be easily distinguished by their name.
        </p>

        <p>
            The {@link com.codename1.io.FileSystemStorage} API provides a <code>getRoots()</code> call to list the root 
            directories of the file system (you can then "dig in" via the <code>listFiles</code> API). However, 
            this is confusing and unintuitive for developers.
        </p>

        <p>
            To simplify the process of creating/reading files we added the <code>getAppHomePath()</code> method. 
            This method allows us to obtain the path to a directory where files can be stored/read.
        </p>

        <p>
            We can use this directory to place an image to share as we did in the 
            <a href="https://www.codenameone.com/manual/components.html#sharebutton-section">share sample</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Warning:</strong> A common Android hack is to write files to the SDCard storage to share 
            them among apps. Android 4.x disabled the ability to write to arbitrary directories on the SDCard 
            even when the appropriate permission was requested.
        </p>

        <p>
            A more advanced usage of the {@link com.codename1.io.FileSystemStorage} API can be a 
            {@link com.codename1.io.FileSystemStorage} <code>Tree</code>:
        </p>

        <h4>Storage vs. File System</h4>
        <p>
            The question of storage vs. file system is often confusing for novice mobile developers. This embeds 
            two separate questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Why are there 2 API's where one would have worked?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Which one should I pick?</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The main reasons for the 2 API's are technical. Many OS's provide 2 ways of accessing data 
            specific to the app and this is reflected within the API. E.g. on Android the 
            {@link com.codename1.io.FileSystemStorage} maps to API's such as <code>java.io.FileInputStream</code> 
            whereas the {@link com.codename1.io.Storage} maps to <code>Context.openFileInput()</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The secondary reason for the two API's is conceptual. {@link com.codename1.io.FileSystemStorage} is 
            more powerful and in a sense provides more ways to fail, this is compounded by the complex 
            on-device behavior of the API. {@link com.codename1.io.Storage} is designed to be friendlier to the 
            uninitiated and more portable.
        </p>

        <p>
            You should pick {@link com.codename1.io.Storage} unless you have a specific requirement that prevents it. 
            Some API's such as <code>Capture</code> expect a {@link com.codename1.io.FileSystemStorage} URI 
            so in those cases this would also be a requirement.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another case where {@link com.codename1.io.FileSystemStorage} is beneficial is the case of hierarchy or 
            native API usage. If you need a a directory structure or need to communicate with a native 
            API the {@link com.codename1.io.FileSystemStorage} approach is usually easier.<br>
            <strong>Warning: </strong>In some OS's the {@link com.codename1.io.FileSystemStorage} API can find the 
            content of the {@link com.codename1.io.Storage} API. As one is implemented on top of the other. This is 
            undocumented behavior that can change at any moment!
        </p>

        <h3>Network Manager &amp; Connection Request</h3>
        <p>
            One of the more common problems in Network programming is spawning a new thread to handle 
            the network operations. In Codename One this is done seamlessly and becomes unessential 
            thanks to the {@link com.codename1.io.NetworkManager}.
        </p>
        <p>
            {@link com.codename1.io.NetworkManager} effectively alleviates the need for managing network threads by 
            managing the complexity of network threading.  The connection request class can be used to 
            facilitate web service requests when coupled with the JSON/XML parsing capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            To open a connection one needs to use a {@link com.codename1.io.ConnectionRequest}
            object, which has some similarities to the networking mechanism in JavaScript but is obviously somewhat more elaborate.</p>
        <p>You can send a get request to a URL using something like:</p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/codenameone/08f8de7590674e47683b.js"></script>

        <p>
            Notice that you can also implement the same thing and much more by avoiding the response 
            listener code and instead overriding the methods of the {@link com.codename1.io.ConnectionRequest} class 
            which offers multiple points to override e.g.
        </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/codenameone/f7e2f95e5beb11901e1c.js"></script>


        <p>
            Notice that overriding <code>buildRequestBody(OutputStream)</code> will only work for 
            <code>POST</code> requests and will replace writing the arguments.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> You don't need to close the output/input streams passed to the 
            request methods. They are implicitly cleaned up.
        </p>

        <p>
            {@link com.codename1.io.NetworkManager} also supports synchronous requests which work in a similar 
            way to <code>Dialog</code> via the <code>invokeAndBlock</code> call and thus don't block 
            the EDT illegally. E.g. you can do something like this:
        </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/codenameone/bf1d90a391a6ffda8695.js"></script>


        <p>
            Notice that in this case the <code>addToQueueAndWait</code> method returned after the 
            connection completed. Also notice that this was totally legal to do on the EDT!
        </p>

        <h4>Threading</h4>
        <p>
            By default the {@link com.codename1.io.NetworkManager} launches with a single network thread. This is 
            sufficient for very simple applications that don't do too much networking but if you need to 
            fetch many images concurrently and perform web services in parallel this might be an issue.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Warning:</strong> Once you increase the thread count there is no guarantee of order for your requests. Requests 
            might not execute in the order with which you added them to the queue!
        </p>
        <p>To update the number of threads use:</p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/codenameone/6b83eaa251b3d0003016.js"></script>

        <p>
            All the callbacks in the {@code ConnectionRequest} occur on the network thread and 
            <strong>not on the EDT</strong>!
        </p>

        <p>
            There is one exception to this rule which is the <code>postResponse()</code> method designed 
            to update the UI after the networking code completes.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> Never change the UI from a {@link com.codename1.io.ConnectionRequest} 
            callback. You can either use a listener on the {@link com.codename1.io.ConnectionRequest}, use 
            <code>postResponse()</code> (which is the only exception to this rule) or wrap your UI code with 
            {@link com.codename1.ui.Display#callSerially(java.lang.Runnable)}.
        </p>

        <h4>Arguments, Headers &amp; Methods</h4>
        <p>
            HTTP/S is a complex protocol that expects complex encoded data for its requests. Codename 
            One tries to simplify and abstract most of these complexities behind common sense API's while 
            still providing the full low level access you would expect from such an API.
        </p>

        <h5>Arguments</h5>
        <p>
            HTTP supports several "request methods", most commonly <code>GET</code> &amp; 
            <code>POST</code> but also a few others such as <code>HEAD</code>, <code>PUT</code>, 
            <code>DELETE</code> etc.
        </p>

        <p>Arguments in HTTP are passed differently between <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> 
            methods. That is what the <code>setPost</code> method in Codename One determines, whether 
            arguments added to the request should be placed using the <code>GET</code> semantics or the 
            <code>POST</code> semantics.</p>

        <p>So if we continue our example from above we can do something like this:</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/codenameone/7970bcb0f09f9ad24ef9.js"></script>

        <p>
            This will implicitly add a get argument with the content of <code>value</code>. Notice that we 
            don't really care what value is. It's implicitly HTTP encoded based on the get/post semantics. 
            In this case it will use the get encoding since we passed <code>false</code> to the constructor.
        </p>

        <p>A simpler implementation could do something like this:</p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/codenameone/78f498161c730dd365c3.js"></script>

        <p>
            This would be almost identical but doesn't provide the convenience for switching back and 
            forth between <code>GET</code>/<code>POST</code> and it isn't as fluent.
        </p>

        <p>We can skip the encoding in complex cases where server code expects illegal HTTP 
            characters (this happens) using the <code>addArgumentNoEncoding</code> method. We can 
            also add multiple arguments with the same key using <code>addArgumentArray</code>.
        </p>

        <h5>Methods</h5>
        <p>
            As we explained above, the <code>setPost()</code> method allows us to manipulate the 
            get/post semantics of a request. This implicitly changes the <code>POST</code> 
            or <code>GET</code> method submitted to the server.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, if you wish to have finer grained control over the submission process e.g. for making a 
            <code>HEAD</code> request you can do this with code like:
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/codenameone/2aa6b21aa6d57d00bd05.js"></script>

        <h5>Headers</h5>
        <p>
            When communicating with HTTP servers we often pass data within headers mostly for 
            authentication/authorization but also to convey various properties.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some headers are builtin as direct API's e.g. content type is directly exposed within the API 
            since it's a pretty common use case. We can set the content type of a post request using:
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/codenameone/fc66ddfde85ec9d96185.js"></script>

        <p>
            We can also add any arbitrary header type we want, e.g. a very common use case is basic 
            authorization where the authorization header includes the Base64 encoded user/password 
            combination as such:
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/codenameone/08babc9b08460ff05400.js"></script>


        <p>This can be quite tedious to do if you want all requests from your app to use this header. 
            For this use case you can just use:</p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/codenameone/083c1c1ccf45db55a55a.js"></script>

        <h5>Server Headers</h5>
        <p>
            Server returned headers are a bit trickier to read. We need to subclass the connection request 
            and override the <code>readHeaders</code> method e.g.:
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/codenameone/3c9ffaef41f523426552.js"></script>

        <p>
            Here we can extract the headers one by one to handle complex headers such as cookies, 
            authentication etc.
        </p>

        <h5>Error Handling</h5>
        <p>
            As you noticed above practically all of the methods in the <code>ConectionRequest</code> 
            throw <code>IOException</code>. This allows you to avoid the <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code> 
            semantics and just let the error propagate up the chain so it can be handled uniformly by 
            the application.
        </p>

        <p>There are two distinct placed where you can handle a networking error:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The {@link com.codename1.io.ConnectionRequest} - by overriding callback methods</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The {@link com.codename1.io.NetworkManager} error handler</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Notice that the {@link com.codename1.io.NetworkManager} error handler takes precedence thus allowing 
            you to define a global policy for network error handling by consuming errors.
        </p>
        <p>
            E.g. if I would like to block all network errors from showing anything to the user I could do 
            something like this:</p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/codenameone/114c4a7253db84c7654d.js"></script>

        <p>
            The error listener is invoked first with the {@link com.codename1.io.NetworkEvent} matching the 
            error. Consuming the event prevents it from propagating further down the chain into the 
            {@link com.codename1.io.ConnectionRequest} callbacks.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can also override the error callbacks of the various types in the request e.g. in the case of a 
            server error code we can do:
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/codenameone/a3bc133ad3d3ed11c150.js"></script>


        <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> The error callback callback is triggered in the network thread!<br>
            As a result it can't access the UI to show a <code>Dialog</code> or anything like that.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another approach is to use the <code>setFailSilently(true)</code> method on the 
            {@link com.codename1.io.ConnectionRequest}. This will prevent the 
            {@link com.codename1.io.ConnectionRequest} from displaying any errors to the user. It's a very 
            powerful strategy if you use the synchronous version of the API's e.g.:
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/codenameone/9ec6fe3b79d95f15661d.js"></script>

        <p>
            This code will only work with the synchronous "AndWait" version of the method since the response 
            code will take a while to return for the non-wait version.
        </p>

        <h5>Error Stream</h5>
        <p>
            When we get an error code that isn't 200/300 we ignore the result. This is problematic as the 
            result might contain information we need. E.g. many webservices provide further XML/JSON 
            based details describing the reason for the error code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Calling <code>setReadResponseForErrors(true)</code> will trigger a mode where even errors 
            will receive the <code>readResponse</code> callback with the error stream. This also means 
            that API's like <code>getData</code> and the listener API's will also work correctly in 
            case of error.
        </p>


        <h4>GZIP</h4>

            Gzip is a very common compression format based on the lz algorithm, it's used by web servers 
            around the world to compress data.
        </p>

        <p>
            Codename One supports {@link com.codename1.io.gzip.GZIPInputStream} and 
            {@link com.codename1.io.gzip.GZIPOutputStream}, which allow you to compress data 
            seamlessly into a stream and extract compressed data from a stream. This is very useful and 
            can be applied to every arbitrary stream.
        </p>

        <p>
            Codename One also features a {@link com.codename1.io.gzip.GZConnectionRequest}, which 
            will automatically unzip an HTTP response if it is indeed gzipped. Notice that some devices (iOS) 
            always request gzip'ed data and always decompress it for us, however in the case of iOS it 
            doesn't remove the gziped header. The <code>GZConnectionRequest</code> is aware of such 
            behaviors so its better to use that when connecting to the network (if applicable).
        </p>

        <p>
            By default <code>GZConnectionRequest</code> doesn't request gzipped data (only unzips it 
            when its received) but its pretty easy to do so just add the HTTP header 
            <code>Accept-Encoding: gzip</code> e.g.:
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/codenameone/9a4c6f49d836ca173235.js"></script>

        <p>Do the rest as usual and you should have smaller responses from the servers.</p>

        <h4>File Upload</h4>
        <p>
            {@link com.codename1.io.MultipartRequest} tries to simplify the process of uploading a file from 
            the local device to a remote server.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can always submit data in the <code>buildRequestBody</code> but this is flaky and has 
            some limitations in terms of devices/size allowed. HTTP standardized file upload capabilities 
            thru the multipart request protocol, this is implemented by countless servers and is well 
            documented. Codename One supports this out of the box.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since we assume most developers reading this will be familiar with Java here is the way to 
            implement the multipart upload in the servlet API.
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/codenameone/9cad1248365512416101.js"></script>

        <p>
            {@link com.codename1.io.MultipartRequest} is a {@link com.codename1.io.ConnectionRequest} 
            most stuff you expect from there should work. Even addArgument etc.
        </p>

        
        
        <h4>Parsing</h4>

        <p>Codename One has several built in parsers for JSON, XML, CSV &amp; Properties formats. You can 
            use those parsers to read data from the Internet or data that is shipping with your product. E.g. use the 
            CSV data to setup default values for your application.</p>

        <p>
            All our parsers are designed with simplicity and small distribution size; they don't validate and will fail 
            in odd ways when faced with broken data. The main logic behind this is that validation takes up CPU 
            time on the device where CPU is a precious resource.
        </p>

        <h5>Parsing CSV</h5>

        <p>
            CSV is probably the easiest to use, the "Comma Separated Values" format is just a list of values 
            separated by commas (or some other character) with new lines to indicate another row in the table. 
            These usually map well to an Excel spreadsheet or database table and are supported by default in all 
            spreadsheets.
        </p>

        <p>
            To parse a CSV just use the 
            <a href="https://www.codenameone.com/javadoc/com/codename1/io/CSVParser.html">CSVParser</a> class as such:
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/codenameone/e60d45dcd79c91be9d31.js"></script>
        <img src="https://www.codenameone.com/img/developer-guide/csv-parsing.png" alt="CSV parsing results, notice the properly escaped parentheses and comma" />


        <p>
            The data contains a two dimensional array of the CSV content. You can change the delimiter character 
            by using the {@code CSVParser} constructor that accepts a character.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Notice that we used {@link com.codename1.io.CharArrayReader} for 
            this sample. Normally you would want to use {@link java.util.InputStreamReader} for real world data.
        </p>

        <h5>JSON</h5>
        
        <p>
            The JSON ("Java Script Object Notation") format is popular on the web for passing values to/from 
            webservices since it works so well with JavaScript. Parsing JSON is just as easy but has two 
            different variations. You can use the 
            {@link com.codename1.io.JSONParser} class to build a tree of the JSON data as such:
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/codenameone/dd0537936bb79608692c.js"></script>
        
        <p>
            The response is a {@code Map} containing a nested hierarchy of {@code Collection} ({@code java.util.List}), 
            Strings and numbers to represent the content of the submitted JSON. To extract the data from a specific 
            path just iterate the {@code Map} keys and recurs into it.
        </p>

        <p>
            The sample below uses results from <a href="https://anapioficeandfire.com/">an API of ice and fire</a> 
            that queries structured data about the "Song Of Ice &amp; Fire" book series. Here is a sample result 
            returned from the API for the query 
            <a href="http://www.anapioficeandfire.com/api/characters?page=5&pageSize=3">http://www.anapioficeandfire.com/api/characters?page=5&pageSize=3</a>:
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/codenameone/c00e2e09aa03cc24e1d3.js"></script>
        
        <p>
            We will place that into a file named "anapioficeandfire.json" in the src directory to make the next 
            sample simpler:
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/codenameone/808f436c34444c8143b3.js"></script>
        
        <ol>
            <li>The {@code JSONParser} returns a {@code Map} which is great if the root object is a {@code Map} 
                but in some cases its a list of elements (as is the case above). In this case a special case {@code "root"} 
                element is created to contain the actual list of elements.</li>
            <li>We rely that the entries are all maps, this might not be the case for every API type.</li>
            <li>Notice that the "titles" and "aliases" entries are both lists of elements. We use {@code java.util.List} 
                to avoid a clash with {@code com.codename1.ui.List}.</li>
        </ol>


        <img src="https://www.codenameone.com/img/developer-guide/json-parsing.png" alt="Parsed JSON result, clicking the elements opens the URL from the JSON" />

        <p>
            <b>Tip:</b> The structure of the returned map is sometimes unintuitive when looking at the raw JSON. The easiest 
            thing to do is set a breakpoint on the method and use the inspect variables capability of your IDE to 
            inspect the returned element hierarchy while writing the code to extract that data
        </p>


        <p>
            An alternative approach is to use the static data parse() method of the {@code JSONParser} class and 
            implement a callback parser e.g.: {@code JSONParser.parse(reader, callback);}
        </p>

        <p>
            Notice that a static version of the method is used! The callback object is an instance of the 
            {@code JSONParseCallback} interface, which includes multiple methods. These methods are invoked 
            by the parser to indicate internal parser states, this is similar to the way traditional XML SAX event 
            parsers work.
        </p>

        <h5>XML Parsing</h5>

        <p>
            The {@link com.codename1.xml.XMLParser} started its life as an HTML parser built for displaying 
            mobile HTML. That usage has since been deprecated but the parser can still parse many HTML 
            pages and is very "loose" in terms of verification. This is both good and bad as the parser will work 
            with invalid data without complaining.
        </p>

        <p>
            The simplest usage of {@link com.codename1.xml.XMLParser} looks a bit like this:
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/codenameone/b240756906f41ca72539.js"></script>

        <p>
            The {@link com.codename1.xml.Element} contains children and attributes. It represents a tag within the 
            XML document and even the root document itself. You can iterate over the XML tree to extract the 
            data from within the XML file.
        </p>

        <p>
            We have a great sample of working with {@code XMLParser} in the
            {@link com.codename1.ui.tree.Tree} class.
        </p>

        <h5>XPath Processing</h5>
        <p>
            Codename One ships with support to a subset of XPath processing, you can read more about it in
            the {@link com.codename1.processing processing package docs}.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Externalizable Objects</h3>

        <p>
            Codename One provides the {@link com.codename1.io.Externalizable}  interface, which is similar 
            to the Java SE {@link com.codename1.io.Externalizable} interface.
            This interface allows an object to declare itself as {@link com.codename1.io.Externalizable} for 
            serialization (so an object can be stored in a file/storage or sent over the network). However, due to the 
            lack of reflection and use of obfuscation these objects must be registered with the 
            {@link com.codename1.io.Util} class.
        </p>

        <p>
            Codename One doesn't support the Java SE Serialization API due to the size issues and 
            complexities related to obfuscation.
        </p>

        <p>
            The major objects that are supported by default in the Codename One 
            {@link com.codename1.io.Externalizable} are:
            <code>String</code>, <code>Collection</code>, <code>Map</code>, <code>ArrayList</code>, 
            <code>HashMap</code>, <code>Vector</code>, <code>Hashtable</code>, 
            <code>Integer</code>, <code>Double</code>, <code>Float</code>, <code>Byte</code>, 
            <code>Short</code>, <code>Long</code>, <code>Character</code>, <code>Boolean</code>, 
            <code>Object[]</code>, <code>byte[]</code>, <code>int[]</code>, <code>float[]</code>, 
            <code>long[]</code>, <code>double[]</code>.
        </p>

        <p>Externalizing an object such as h below should work just fine:</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/codenameone/585a38057956861a8641.js"></script>


        <p>
            However, notice that some things aren't polymorphic e.g. if we will externalize a 
            <code>String[]</code> we will get back an <code>Object[]</code> since <code>String</code> 
            arrays aren't detected by the implementation.
        </p>


        <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> The externalization process caches objects so the app will seem to 
            work and only fail on restart!
        </p>

        <p>
            Implementing the {@link com.codename1.io.Externalizable} interface is only important when we 
            want to store a proprietary object. In this case we must register the object with the 
            <code>com.codename1.io.Util</code> class so the externalization algorithm will be able to 
            recognize it by name by invoking:
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/codenameone/98939f91d5bae79afe9e.js"></script>                

        <p>
            You should do this early on in the app e.g. in the <code>init(Object)</code> but you shouldn't do 
            it in a static initializer within the object as that might never be invoked!
        </p>

        <p>
            An {@link com.codename1.io.Externalizable} object <strong>must</strong> have a 
            <strong>default public constructor</strong> and must implement the following 4 methods:
        </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/codenameone/dbaf28959c2f1012e018.js"></script>

        <p>
            The <code>getVersion()</code> method returns the current version of the object allowing the 
            stored data to change its structure in the future (the version is then passed when internalizing 
            the object). The object id is a <code>String</code> uniquely representing the object;
            it usually corresponds to the class name (in the example above the Unique Name should be 
            <code>MyClass</code>).
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Warning:</strong> It's a common mistake to use <code>getClass().getName()</code> 
            to implement <code>getObjectId()</code> and it would <strong>seem to work</strong> in the 
            simulator. This isn't the case though!<br>
            Since devices obfuscate the class names this becomes a problem as data is stored in a random 
            name that changes with every release.
        </p>

        <p>
            Developers need to write the data of the object in the externalize method using the methods in the 
            data output stream and read the data of the object in the internalize method e.g.:
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/codenameone/b94d418ed771c63ffd6f.js"></script>

        <p>
            Since strings might be null sometimes we also included convenience methods to implement such 
            externalization. This effectively writes a boolean before writing the UTF to indicate whether the string 
            is null:
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/codenameone/843b48b703431236c875.js"></script>

        <p>
            Assuming we added a new date field to the object we can do the following. Notice that a 
            <code>Date</code> is really a <code>long</code> value in Java that can be null. 
            For completeness the full class is presented below:</p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/codenameone/ebfffaffd405ed3b7723.js"></script>
        <p>Notice that we only need to check for compatibility during the reading process as the writing 
            process always writes the latest version of the data.</p>
