            The implementation package should not be used by developers, it is an internal implementation detail
            which will break compatibility between major Codename One releases. The purpose of this package is to provide
            ISVs, vendors and operators with the ability to customize &amp; enhance Codename One from within without 
            breaking compatability with existing Codename One applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            A vendor extension begins by extending the CodenameOneImplementation class and implementing the abstract
            methods within. To use this version of the implementation a user can use the Display class and link
            to a vendor JAR that doesn't include any portion of Codename One.
