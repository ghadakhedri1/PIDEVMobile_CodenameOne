        <p>
            The contacts API provides us with the means to query the phone’s address book, delete elements from 
            it and create new entries into it.

            Notice that on some platforms this will prompt the user for permissions and the user might choose not 
            to grant that permission. To detect whether this is the case you can invoke 
            {@link com.codename1.Display#isContactsPermissionGranted()} after invoking the contact listing API. 
            This can help you adapt your error message to the user.

            Codename One API's:
